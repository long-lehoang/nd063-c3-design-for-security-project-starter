1.What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Change security groups
- Restrict Permission (only read access) on Attack Instance
- Disable Password Authentication
2.Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- Yes, we can use VPC private endpoints for S3 and attach policy to prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
3.Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
- When we apply a default encryption setting to an S3 bucket, it only applies to new objects uploaded to the bucket. 
  Any existing objects in the bucket will remain unencrypted until they are re-uploaded or updated.
4.The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?
- Prevent copy from the secret bucket (restrict permission to s3)
- Prevent brute-force attacks on web instances (disable password authentication)
- Prevent access to web instance (update network traffic to instance)
