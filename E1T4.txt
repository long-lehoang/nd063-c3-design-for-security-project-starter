1.Untrusted subnet: The scenario mentions that scripts simulating an attack will be run from a separate instance that is in an untrusted subnet. 
    This means that the attacker is already inside the network and can potentially bypass perimeter security measures. 
    To mitigate this risk, network segmentation should be used to isolate critical resources, such as the web application server and the S3 buckets, from the untrusted subnet. 
    Additionally, security groups and network ACLs should be configured to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to only necessary ports and protocols.
2.Public-facing web service: The public-facing web service is hosted by an HTTP load balancer listening on port 80. 
    However, there is no mention of any security measures being put in place to protect against common web application attacks such as SQL injection, 
    cross-site scripting (XSS), or cross-site request forgery (CSRF). 
    To mitigate these risks, the web service should be configured with appropriate security measures, such as input validation, output encoding, and use of secure cookies.
