3.Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information?
- Based on AWS Flow Logs: 
    GuardDuty can analyze AWS Flow Logs to identify patterns of network traffic that indicate a potential brute force attack. 
    If there is a sudden increase in network traffic to an EC2 instance from a specific IP address or a range of IP addresses, 
    this may indicate an attacker attempting to gain unauthorized access.
