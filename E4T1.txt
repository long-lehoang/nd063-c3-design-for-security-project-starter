1. Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet:
    a. Use network security groups to restrict access - We can use network security groups to restrict access to our AWS resources. 
    By limiting access to only the necessary ports and IP ranges, we can reduce the attack surface and prevent attackers from launching brute force attacks.

    b. Implement AWS WAF - AWS WAF provides a web application firewall that can protect our applications from brute force attacks. 
    We can use AWS WAF to block requests that match certain patterns, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address.

    c. Monitor our environment with AWS GuardDuty - AWS GuardDuty can detect and alert us to potential brute force attacks in real-time. 
    By monitoring our environment with GuardDuty, we can quickly identify and respond to any malicious activity.

2. Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; 
even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?
    Use encryption - Use server-side encryption to encrypt the contents of the secret recipes bucket. 
    By encrypting the data, even if an attacker gains access to the bucket, they will not be able to read the contents without the encryption key.
